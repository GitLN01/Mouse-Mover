# Mouse-Mover

This type of application is often used to prevent your PC from entering sleep mode, screen lock or screen saver mode.

## How to run

1. First of all, you need to have installed ```VS Code``` with ```Python Extension```, and then you need to download or pull code from this repository.
  
2. Then you need to open your ```cmd``` or ```Windows PowerShell```, and navigate towards the downloaded directory using this command: ```cd "YourDisk:\Downloads\Mouse-Mover-main"```, and then run these set of commands one by one:
   
    +```pip install Flask```
    +```pip install pynput```
    +```pip install sysmonitor```
   
4. Then open Mouse-Mover-main folder using VS Code, and open ```app.py``` file, and run it by pressing an arrow on the top right corner:
